    <p>Firstly, Jujutsu Kaisen excels in character development. The protagonist, Yuji Itadori, is not your typical hero; heâ€™s motivated by a desire to live a meaningful life and protect others. Unlike many protagonists who follow a rigid moral code, Yuji grapples with morally complex decisions, especially in his journey to rid the world of curses. His relationships with fellow sorcerers, like the introspective Megumi Fushiguro and the fierce Nobara Kugisaki, add depth to his character, and each team member has a unique, fully realized personality. This ensemble cast adds richness to the story, making every interaction feel significant.</p>
